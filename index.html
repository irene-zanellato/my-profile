	 	  <p>
	 		I am a Business and Management undergraduate student with a broad interest in Real Estate and Personal Development.
	 		I'm always looking for further ways to improve myself and better every aspect of my life. 
	 		And, of course, I am also very fond of travelling!

	 		Books
	      </h2>
	      <p>
	    	I am literally addicted to books!
	    	I consider them a wonderful way to acquire new knowledge and gain a different perspective on the world (or a specific topic), as you can see through the author’s eyes… and heart.

			Travels
		  </h2>
		  <p>
			I am completely and irremediably in love with traveling!
			You can benefit immensely from it in a myriad of ways… You can discover different cultures, you can learn new languages, and my personal favorite, you can meet countless people that you will forever call “friends”.

			Scuba Diving
		  </h2>
		  <p>
			As I always like to joke, earth is covered by 71% of water… this means that you are missing out on 71% of places to discover on earth! Fortunately, there is a quick fix: scuba diving! I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to discover the underwater world and also help other people to immerse themselves in it as a Scuba Diving Guide! It’s an experience words can’t describe… so… I would suggest trying it, I can take you! ;)
